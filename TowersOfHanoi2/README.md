Project Towers of Hanoi 1.0

The project is a Towers of Hanoi game with an auto solver.
After opening the file, you can drag the blocks around and it'll snap onto a peg if the move is valid.  Or, you can click on the auto solver to have the puzle solved step by step.
The project utilizes stacks to emulate the stacks of blocks.

KNOWN BUGS:
1. The blocks will overlap onto each to other sometimes but in every case it is because the block position (zero based indexing from the bottom) matched the size of the stack.
2. Beaacuse of bug 1, the auto solver cannot function properly
